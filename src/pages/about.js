    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>For the better part of a decade I've worked in various aspects of web development ranging from frontend design, backend API development, to managing servers and automating processes.</p>
    <p>My interest in technology and web development has been lifelong. I made my first website at 13 on Geocities, started teaching myself Python in college, and setup my first server on an old Dell Optiplex not long after that.</p>
    <p>I have a degree in Computer Engineering from the University of South Florida, and a minor in Physics.</p>
